# AI Healthcare Assistant

## My Idea: AI-Powered Mental Health App

Problem: Mental health issues are often overlooked due to stigma or lack of awareness.<br>
Solution: Build an AI-powered mental health assistant that uses NLP to analyze user input and detect signs of stress, anxiety, or depression. It could provide helpful resources, suggest mindfulness activities, or even escalate severe cases to a trusted contact or hotline.<br>

Features:<br>
- Chat interface for users to express feelings.
- Sentiment analysis and mood tracking.
- Personalized activity recommendations based on mental state.
- Weekly progress reports.
- Innovation: Integrate gamification (e.g., users earn points for completing mindfulness tasks) to encourage usage.
