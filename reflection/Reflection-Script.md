## Introduction (20-30 seconds)
Hi everyone! Today I want to share my experience developing an AI-powered mental health support application. This project has been incredibly meaningful to me as it combines cutting-edge technology with real social impact. Over the past few months, I've built an application that aims to make mental health support more accessible and engaging through artificial intelligence.

## Core Development Experience
Working with the Qwen 2.5 language model was both challenging and fascinating. I had to ensure the AI responses were not only technically accurate but also empathetic and supportive. One of the biggest technical challenges was implementing real-time sentiment analysis while keeping the interface responsive. It took several iterations to get the balance right between performance and user experience.

## Key Learning Moments
The most significant learning came when integrating the AI model with the activity recommendation system. I discovered that by analyzing user mood patterns, we could provide more personalized and timely support. There were moments of trial and error, especially when dealing with concurrent database operations, but each challenge helped me grow as a developer.

## Impact and Outcomes
What makes me proud about this project is how it evolved from a technical concept into a tool that could genuinely help people. The application now successfully tracks user moods, suggests personalized activities, and maintains engaging conversations - all while keeping data secure and private. The gamification elements we added helped make mental health management more engaging and less intimidating.

## Looking Forward
This project has opened my eyes to the possibilities at the intersection of AI and healthcare. Moving forward, I'm excited to explore more ways to leverage technology for mental health support, possibly expanding into areas like predictive analytics and personalized intervention strategies.
