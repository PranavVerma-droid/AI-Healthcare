How clear were the instructions provided for the workshop?
Initially, the instructions were somewhat unclear and troublesome to understand. I had to reach out for clarification multiple times to fully 
grasp the project requirements and expectations. Better structured documentation would have helped streamline the process.

How effectively did the workshop help you develop your business strategy?
The workshop was quite effective in helping me develop my business strategy. Through the process, I learned to identify market needs, 
particularly in mental healthcare, and developed a comprehensive plan for Project Stacy that addresses real-world problems while maintaining 
commercial viability.

How useful were the interactive sessions in enhancing your understanding of strategic planning?
The interactive sessions were invaluable. They provided practical insights into project planning, helped me refine my ideas through peer feedback, 
and gave me a better understanding of how to structure a complex AI healthcare solution.

Did the workshop meet your expectations in terms of content and practical application?
Yes, despite the initial confusion with instructions, the workshop exceeded my expectations. It provided a solid framework for developing a 
real-world AI application and helped me transform my theoretical knowledge into a practical, working solution.

How would you describe the quality of the feedback and discussions during the presentation?
The feedback sessions were highly constructive and insightful. Peers and mentors provided valuable suggestions that helped improve Project Stacy's 
features and implementation. The discussions challenged my assumptions and led to better design decisions.

How well did you feel the workshop supported your development of business strategies using available resources?
The workshop provided excellent support in terms of resource utilization. It helped me understand how to leverage existing technologies 
(like Qwen 2.5) effectively while working within technical constraints to create a viable product.

How likely are you to apply the skills and knowledge gained from this workshop in your future projects?
Extremely likely. The skills I've gained - from project planning to AI implementation and user-centered design - are directly applicable to future 
projects. I've already started applying these principles to new ideas I'm developing.

What aspect of the workshop did you find most beneficial?
The most beneficial aspect was the hands-on development experience combined with strategic planning. Learning to balance technical capabilities with 
user needs while maintaining privacy and security was particularly valuable.

What improvements, if any, would you suggest for future workshops?
I would suggest clearer initial documentation and project requirements to reduce confusion. Additionally, more structured mentorship sessions and 
perhaps a more detailed timeline for project milestones would be helpful.

Do you have any additional comments or feedback about the workshop experience?
Overall, it was an enriching experience that helped me grow both technically and professionally. While the initial unclear instructions were 
challenging, overcoming these obstacles added to the learning experience. The opportunity to develop a meaningful project like Stacy was incredibly rewarding.
